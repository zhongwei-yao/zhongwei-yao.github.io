## 📝 Working Papers

### In circulation

"[Belief dispersion in the Chinese stock market and fund flows](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4599464)", with Yue Fang and Deming Luo.

> We construct a text-based degree of disagreement (DOD) about stock market performance among fund managers using deep learning models.  In the time series, the DOD negatively predicts market returns. In the cross section, fund investors correctly perceive the DOD as an overpricing signal and discount fund performance accordingly. Flow-performance sensitivity is diminished during high dispersion periods.
